= Contribution guideline


== Contribute code

We always want new commands. You can new commands or new options and send a pull request.

Modifying the behavior of existing commands must be discussed. 

=== Steps

. Log an issue in https://github.com/hbt/mouseless/issues explaining the new command, bug etc.
. Fix it and refer to issue number in commit
. Send a pull request

We try to process all pull requests within a week. 


NOTE: Do not bother proposing a mapping. It will be ignored. Add the new function as an isolated module and it will be merged.
